Tell your doctor clearly, \"Please refer me to NSC for the vitiligo ruxolitinib (JAK cream) programme.\"\n       - Eligible referral sources: Public healthcare polyclinics and CHAS GPs\n       - Note: Referrals from NHG and NUHS polyclinics are processed fastest as they use a common electronic system called EPIC.

Wait for NSC to Schedule the Appointment\n       - Once the polyclinic/GP submits the referral, NSC will schedule the appointment and inform both your doctor and you.\n       - You'll be seen at NSC's Pigment Clinic.\n\n2.

One of their ongoing clinical trials involves offering Ruxolitinib cream, a JAK inhibitor, at no cost on top of subsidized consultation fees for eligible vitiligo patients. This trial aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of this treatment in managing vitiligo.\n\nTo participate in the trial, you need to meet certain eligibility criteria and follow a specific enrollment process:\n\n1. Eligibility Criteria:\n   - Be a Singapore citizen or permanent resident.\n   - Have stable vitiligo for at least 6 months before the trial start date.\n   - Not have any significant skin disease other than vitiligo.\n   - Not be pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding during the study period.\n   - Not have any active or chronic systemic illnesses that could affect your participation in the trial.\n   - Meet other specific criteria as determined by the investigators.\n\n2. Enrollment Process:\n   a. Public healthcare referral (subsidized consultation):\n      - Visit a public healthcare polyclinic or CHAS GP (as a CHAS cardholder) to get a referral letter to NSC for the \"Vitiligo Ruxo Programme.\"\n         - Tell your doctor clearly: “Please refer me to NSC for the vitiligo ruxolitinib (JAK cream) programme.”\n      - Eligible referral sources: NHG Polyclinics, National University Polyclinics, or CHAS GPs. Note that referrals from NHG and NUHS polyclinics can be processed fastest due to a common electronic system.\n   b. Direct appointment booking (non-subsidized consultation):\n      - Contact NSC via email at [appointment@nsc.com.sg](mailto:appointment@nsc.com.sg) or call (+65) 6350 6666, stating clearly: “I would like to be seen for the vitiligo ruxolitinib (JAK cream) programme.”\n\nAfter you've followed these steps and meet the eligibility criteria, NSC will schedule your appointment at their Pigment Clinic. If you go through the public referral route, the appointment will be subsidized; otherwise, it will be a non-subsidized consultation.\n\nFor more detailed information, visit the National Skin Centre's website or contact them directly via phone or email.", "success": true, "processing_time_ms": 142566, "api_response": {"success": true, "processing_time_ms": 142566}}

This clinical trial offers a JAK inhibitor cream (Ruxolitinib) to eligible vitiligo patients at no cost on top of subsidized consultation fees.\n\nHere's how you can sign up for this free trial:\n\n1. Get a referral from a public healthcare clinic:\n   - Visit a Polyclinic or CHAS GP (if you hold a CHAS card).\n   - Ask the doctor to refer you to NSC for the \"Vitiligo Ruxo Programme.\"\n   - Eligible referral sources include:\n      1. Public healthcare polyclinics (e.g., Ang Mo Kio, Geylang, Hougang, etc.)\n      2. National University Polyclinics (Bukit Batok Polyclinic, Bukit Panjang Polyclinic, etc.)\n      3. CHAS GPs (if you hold a CHAS card)\n\n2. Wait for NSC to contact you:\n   - Once the polyclinic/GP submits the referral, NSC will schedule your appointment and inform both your doctor and you.\n   - You’ll be seen at NSC’s Pigment Clinic.\n\nPlease note that self-booking the appointment directly with NSC would result in a non-subsidized consultation, which means you'll pay for the private rate. To enjoy subsidized consultation rates and participate in the free trial, it is essential to go through the public referral route.\n\nThe waiting time for appointments at NSC is usually within 60 days. If you have any further questions, I encourage you to contact NSC directly via email (appointment@nsc.com.sg) or call (+65) 6350 6666.", "success": true, "processing_time_ms": 115839, "api_response": {"success": true, "processing_time_ms": 115839}}

The dermatologist will determine whether the new JAK inhibitor cream is suitable for your condition.\n\n4. **Enrollment in the trial**: If you meet the eligibility criteria and the dermatologist approves, you will be enrolled in the clinical trial for the vitiligo cream at no cost, on top of the consultation fee.\n\nPlease remember that the content provided here is for reference only.

Get a Referral from a Public Healthcare Clinic:\n   - Visit either a public healthcare polyclinic or CHAS GP (if you hold a CHAS card) to get a referral letter to NSC.\n   - Tell the doctor clearly: “Please refer me to NSC for the vitiligo ruxolitinib (JAK cream) programme.”\n   - Eligible referral sources:\n     - Public healthcare polyclinics: Ang Mo Kio, Geylang, Hougang, Kallang, Khatib, Sembawang, Toa Payoh, Woodlands, Yishun, etc.\n     - National University Polyclinics: Bukit Batok Polyclinic, Bukit Panjang Polyclinic, Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic, Clementi Polyclinic, Jurong Polyclinic, Pioneer Polyclinic, and Queenstown Polyclinic.\n     - CHAS GPs (if you hold a CHAS card): Ask them to refer you to NSC for the \"Vitiligo Ruxo Programme.\"\n   - Important: Referrals from NHG and NUHS polyclinics are sent directly via a common electronic system (EPIC) and can be processed fastest. Referrals from institutions not on EPIC (SingHealth polyclinics) are through email/fax and may take longer.\n\n2. Allow NSC to Schedule the Appointment:\n   - Once the polyclinic/GP submits the referral, NSC will schedule the appointment and inform both your doctor and you.\n   - You'll be seen at NSC’s Pigment Clinic.\n   - Avoid self-booking if you want free treatment (and subsidised consultation) as self-booking equals private rate, which means paid.\n\nIn case you need to contact NSC for any reason:\n- Email: appointment@nsc.com.sg\n- Phone: (+65) 6350 6666\n\nRemember that only eligible patients will be considered for the free JAK cream trial, and it is essential to follow the guidelines provided. You'll need to wait for an appointment at NSC after securing your referral from a public healthcare clinic.\n\nFAQs:\n\n- Q: Can I call NSC to schedule the appointment myself?\n  A: Yes, but you’ll be considered a non-subsidised patient, which means you'll pay for the non-subsidised consultation. To enjoy subsidised consultation rates, you must go through the public referral route.", "success": true, "processing_time_ms": 178496, "api_response": {"success": true, "processing_time_ms": 178496}}
